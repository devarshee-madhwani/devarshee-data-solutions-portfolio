# Public Health Insights & Community Outcomes Dashboard

## Overview
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze public health indicators such as chronic disease prevalence, vaccination rates, ER wait times, demographic disparities, and regional community outcomes. This project demonstrates strong public-sector analytics capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Public health agencies require consolidated, reliable, and interactive insights to understand community health outcomes across regions. Data is often siloed, static, or difficult to interpret for policy and operational decision-making.

## Objectives
- Consolidate multiple public health datasets.
- Build regional and demographic breakdowns of key health indicators.
- Highlight disparities in outcomes using equity-focused metrics.
- Provide actionable insights for policy and resource allocation.

## Dataset
Sources include:
- Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)
- Public Health Ontario
- WHO / CDC datasets
- Open Government Canada

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (main)
- Microsoft Fabric (optional Lakehouse backend)
- SQL for data shaping
- Looker Studio (optional lightweight variant)

## Key Steps
1. Source and standardize public health datasets.
2. Build dimensional model for Date, Region, Indicator.
3. Create Power BI semantic model with RLS (if needed).
4. Develop KPI visuals: vaccination, wait times, chronic disease rates, health equity.
5. Produce insights and recommendations.

## Insights & Outcomes
- Identified regional inequities in outcomes.
- Highlighted demographic trends requiring targeted intervention.
- Enabled faster interpretation of high-volume public data.
