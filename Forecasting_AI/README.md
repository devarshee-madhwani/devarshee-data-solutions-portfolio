## Forecasting Methods
- ARIMA / SARIMA  
- Prophet  
- LightGBM Regression  
- LSTM (optional deep learning variant)  
- Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)  

## AI Features
- Dynamic executive summary generation (GPT)
- Automated insight narratives
- Scenario simulation (best/worst case)

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Python (Prophet, ARIMA, sklearn)
- Azure ML / MLFlow (optional)
- GPT-based AI insight generation
- Streamlit (interactive forecasting simulator)

## Folder Structure
- `/notebooks` – forecasting experiments  
- `/dashboards` – Power BI visuals  
- `/prompts` – GPT prompt templates  
- `/images` – screenshots
